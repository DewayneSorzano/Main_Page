## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dewayne Sorzano and I am a GIS Graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park.  During my tenure, I studied remote sensing, GIS, and data analysis.
I have utilized a variety of ESRI tools such as ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Online to perform spatial analysis and study satellite imagery. 

I'm currently working on transferring my work within ArcGIS Pro to QGIS.
