## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dewayne Sorzano and I am a GIS Graduate from the University of Maryland, College Park.  During my tenure, I studied remote sensing, GIS, and data analysis.

I'm currently working on using implementing python scripting to automate my project workflows for studying air pollutant concentration within the United States.
