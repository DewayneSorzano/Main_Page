## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dewayne Sorzano and I am a GIS Graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park.  During my tenure, I studied remote sensing, GIS, and data analysis.
I have utilized a variety of ESRI tools ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Online to perform spatial analysis and remote sensing.  My studies involved assessing burn scars, and 
calculating air pollution levels.

I'm currently working on using implementing python scripting to automate my project workflows for studying air pollutant concentration within the United States.
